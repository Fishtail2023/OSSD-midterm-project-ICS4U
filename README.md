Option A: 2D Tic Tac Toe Game 
Project Overview:
The purpose of this project is to develop a simple, console-based 2D Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. This game will allow users to input moves using row and column numbers and will display the board after each move. The project focuses on clear structure, basic game logic, and user interaction through the console.
Objectives are to:
1.	Provide a functional two player game
2.	Allow two players to take turns placing X and O through console input
3.	Display the board with row and column labels
4.	Prevent invalid or duplicate moves
5.	Simulate two turns (four in total moves) as required

Scope of the project:
The game will use 4x4 array internally, where the playable area is 3x3 grid. The program will not include win detection, score tracking, or replay functionality. The project will focus only on simulating turns and displaying the board currently.
Deliverables: 
1.	Java source code file (.java)
2.	Pseudocode documentation
3.	Project plan documentation
   
Timeline:
1.	Planning and design
2.	Pseudocode development
3.	Coding and testing
4.	Final review and submission
   
Milestones:
1.	Plan the game structure and board layout
2.	Write pseudocode for the game logic
3.	Implement the Java program
4.	Test move validation and board display
5.	Final review and submission
